## Why this stack

FlowFit is a solo-built, 3-week after-hours MVP targeting small scale with auth and AI-generated training plans as its two load-bearing features. The 10x Astro Starter is the recommended default for (web-app, js) and clears all four agent-friendly gates: typed (TypeScript + Zod end-to-end), convention-based (Astro file routing, Supabase schema conventions), popular in JS training data, and well-documented. Supabase covers both the auth FRs (FR-001 to FR-003) and the per-user data isolation guardrail via Row Level Security on PostgreSQL. The AI plan-generation feature (FR-006) integrates as an Astro API route calling the Anthropic SDK directly (not OpenRouter — decided in ORQ-2) — no structural change to the starter required. Model: Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`), using structured outputs (`output_config.format` json_schema) to constrain the weekly-plan response shape. Cloudflare Pages deployment is zero-config with this starter; GitHub Actions with auto-deploy-on-merge matches the solo shipping cadence. Bootstrapper confidence is first-class: scaffolding is expected to be smooth with occasional manual steps.
